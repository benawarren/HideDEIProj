## Have you ever worried that the Trump administration would shut down your research because it relates to DEI?

**Well, boy do I have a GitHub repo for you...**

In this repo, I've built (well, myself and ChatGPT) a simple local user interface (HTML/CSS) that wraps around a Python script using Google's gemini LLM API to 
re-write the title and abstract of your research proposal, grant, or paper without a specified list of DEI stopwords. I've included (in the DEIstopwords.txt file)
a list of words the Washington Post reported from an analysis of internal NSF documents, but you can add your own as the administration's efforts become more 
and more draconian!
